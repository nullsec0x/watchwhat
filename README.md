# 🎬 WatchWhat!

**Movie night? We got you.**

Tired of scrolling through Netflix for 40 minutes just to rewatch *Shrek* again?  
**WatchWhat!** smacks you with a random, actually-good movie based on what you're feelin'.

---

##  What It Does

-  Pick by **genre**, **year**, or **rating** — or don’t. Go full chaos.  
-  Light/Dark Mode — depending on your mood (or your battery).  
-  One-click Netflix search — if it’s there, it’s yours.  
-  Clean AF UI — smooth animations, hover stuff, no mess.  
-  Works on phones — ‘cause not everyone’s watching on a TV.

## 🎬 How It Works

1. Set the vibe (or not).  
2. Smash **“Pick a Movie”**.  
3. Boom: Poster. Rating. Netflix link. All there.  
4. Don’t like it? Hit **“Try Another.”** Repeat until you’re vibing.

##  What’s Under the Hood

- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (no libraries, no fluff)  
- **TMDB API** for the movie magic  
- **Google Fonts** – using *Schoolbell* to keep it chill

---

##  Setup (It’s Dumb Easy)

Run this in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/nullsec0x/watchwhat.git`

Then just open `index.html` in your browser. That’s it.

Want to customize it?  
Drop your TMDB API key into `script.js` and you're set.
